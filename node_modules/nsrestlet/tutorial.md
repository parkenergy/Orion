# Setting Up Netsuite Restlets

This tutorial will show you the steps you need to take to set up your Netsuite account so that external program can communicate with it via restlets.

## OAuth v NLAuth

There are two ways to sign in to Netsuite using external applications.

The first way is called NLAuth.  You provide your Username, Password, and Account ID so your application can communicate with Netsuite.  The advantages of using NLAuth are:

1.  It's easy to set up.  Chances are you're already set up for it.

2.  It's familar, because you use a username and password format.

There are some disadvantages to that though.

1. You are providing a password to an application.  If the application is going to be used outside of a secure environment, this method doesn't work well.

2.  Unless you turn the option off, Netsuite will require you to change that password every six months.  You'll need to change the password your applications use because of that.

3.  Applications don't work very well with 2FA (two factor authentication).  This will be required for Administrator and High-Privelage accounts in the future if you are using NLAuth.

OAuth on the other hand, works entirely differently.  Instead, you generate a set of 'keys and secrets' that you give to an application that specify which account is has access to in Netsuite.

OAuth solves all of the disadvantages of NLAuth.

1.  It's easy to remove a 'key and secret' set that has been compromised and generate a new one, so you can use these in any environment.  Furthermore, these keys don't provide any access to login to Netsuite's website.

2.  OAuth tokens don't need to changed every so many months.

3.  OAuth tokens bypass the need for 2FA.

Naturally, it's a bit more difficult to implement, but if you follow this tutorial and use this module, it should be really easy.

This tutorial will show you the steps necessary to prepare your acccount for either form of authentication.

## Enabling Netsuite Settings

First, we need to enable Suitescript.

1. Go to __Setup__ -> __Company__ -> __SuiteCloud__.

2. Enable __Client Suitescript__, and then __Server Suitescript__.

3. You need your __Account ID__.  Go to __Setup__ -> __Integrations__ -> __Web Services Preferences__, and look at the __Account ID__ field.  Copy that number down somewhere.

At this point, you'll need to choose either NLAuth or OAuth.  If running NLAuth, you'll also need your role number:

4. You can get that by going to __Setup__ -> __Users/Roles__ -> __Manage Roles__ and looking up your role number (Administrator isn't listed, but for me it's 3).  You can then jump down to later in this tutorial where we build the actual __RESTlet__.

If you're setting up OAuth, please continue with these steps instead:

4. Scroll down to __Manage Authentication__ section and enable __Token-Based Authentication__

5. We need to create a role that is OAuth enabled (Administrator is not so you'll need to create a new role).  Go to __Setup__ -> __Users/Roles__ -> __Manage Roles__ -> __New__

6. Give the role a Name.

7. In the sublists, go to __Permissions__ -> __Setup__.

8.  Add the Permissions __Access Token Management__, __Log in using Access Tokens__, and __User Access Tokens__.  Then save.

9. We need to add this role to a user (I suggest adding it to yourself if you are testing an application you are making).  Use __Setup__ -> __Users/Roles__ -> __Manage Users__ to find the User you wish to add the role to.  Click edit.

10. In the sublists, go to __Access__ -> __Roles__ and add the role you just created to the user.  Then save.

11. We now need to set up an integration.  Go to __Setup__ -> __Integrations__ -> __Manage Integrations__ -> __New__.

12.  Give your integration a Name and Description.  The integration represents your application to Netsuite.  Make sure to enable __Token Based Authentication__ in the __Authentication__ subtab (you may want to disable __User Credentials__ as well).  Click Save.

13. The __Consumer Key__ and __Consumer Secret__ will display.  Copy these somewhere safe.  You will need them for your application and will not be able to access them again once you navigate away from this page (you can always generate new ones though).

14. We now need to set up a token.  Go to __Setup__ -> __Users/Roles__ -> __Access Tokens__ -> __New__.

15. Select the Application you just created, along with the user and role you selected earlier.  You can also rename the token if you'd like.  The Token reperesnets your user to Netsuite.  Once you're done, click Save.

16. The __Token Key__ and __Token Secret__ will display.  Copy these somewhere safe.  You will need them for your application and will not be able to access them again once you navigate away from this page (you can always generate new ones though).

Once you have your __Account ID__, __Consumer Key__, __Consumer Secret__, __Token Key__, and __Token Secret__ Netsuite is all set up.  You can move on to making a Restlet to communicate to.

## A Simple Restlet Sample

You'll need to set up a testing restlet to try your requests against.  Here are the steps to do so:

1. Go to __Customization__ -> __Scripting__ -> __Scripts__ -> __New__.

Netsuite changes the process for setting up scripts occasionally, so these steps may be a bit different for you.  On my account the steps are:

2. Enter in the name of a script file (or click the + button to upload one from the new computer) and then click __Create Script Record__.  Here's the code that should be in that file:

`````javascript
function test(body)
{
    nlapiLogExecution("debug", "test", JSON.stringify(body))

    //if not using application/json, JSON.Stringifiy() it before returning
    return{
        success: true,
        data: body
    }
}
`````

3. Select a __RESTlet__ script

4. Give the script a name and id.

5. In the files for the __GET__, __POST__, __PUT__, and __DELETE__ functions, type in  __test__ (this is the function name)

6. Go to the __Deployments__ subtab and Enter in a new Deployment Title and Id.  You can leave it on Testing or change it to Released.  If you change it to Released, you will need to go into the script deployment itself and change the role permissions to allow you to use the restlet.

7. Click Save.

8. The fields you will need to use if you use this module will be one of the following (you won't need both):

* The __Script Id__ (which you should see immedately) and the __Deployment Id__ (which you can see by going to the __Deployments__ subtab).
* The __External URL__ (go to the __Deployments__ subtab and click on the link to the actual deployment.  It should be directly visible on the deployment).

And that's it.  You should be set up and ready to go.  Why don't you go take a look at this module and see how you can integrate it into an application.
